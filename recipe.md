# the first step to homemade samosa is to cook the potatoes and peas for the filling.

# To cook the potatoes and peas in a stovetop pressure cooker: Place 3 medium-sized whole potatoes (300 to 450 grams) and 2 to 2.5 cups water in a 3 or 4 litre pressure cooker. On top of the potatoes carefully set a small trivet and pressure cooker-safe bowl with ½ cup green peas. Pressure cook for 5 to 6 whistles or 7 to 8 minutes on medium to medium-high flame. If using an Instant Pot: Place 3 medium-sized whole potatoes in the steel insert of a 6 quart IP. Add 2 cups water.

Check with a knife or fork to see if the potatoes are cooked well.The knife or fork should be able to slide through easily if the potatoes are cooked properly.If the potatoes are undercooked, then cook them for a few more minutes using the pressure cook function.
